                        <span class="date">Date: May 16, 2024<br>18 people attended <br>CCPC Meeting Hall </span><br><br>
                        <p>The Code Crafter Programming Club hosted an introduction to computer graphics on May 16. Twenty-five people who were eager to learn and make something new showed up for the session. The fundamentals of graphic design software and methods for producing eye-catching digital art were covered in the workshop. An introduction to computer graphics, OPENGL, and their applications in the modern world opens the session. Mr. Om Vishesh installed Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and OPENGL following the session using C++and how to import libraries like glw 32. Subsequently, Mr. Priyanshu Verma demonstrated to us how to install OpenGL in Python by using basic command prompt phrases, such as Glfw pyopengl and Pygame. Mr. Priyasnshu Verma showcased two 3D cube projects for us and gave us building instructions. Within a month, the members hope to offer some future activities to help all CCPC members learn the fundamentals of OPENGL. The main objective of the programme is to familiarise all members with the basics of OPENGL and provide them with the necessary skills to create their own 3D projects. Additionally, the programme aims to encourage collaboration and creativity among members in exploring the capabilities of OPENGL for future projects.

                        <h1>GitHub basics and Collaborative coding</h1>
                        <span class="date">Date: March 1, 2024<br>20 people attended<br>CCPC Meeting Hall </span><br><br>
                        <p>On March 1, 2024, the Code Crafter Programming Club organized a GitHub basics and
                            collaborative coding session for its members. The session was attended by 20 people who
                            wanted to learn more about GitHub and its features. The main objective of the session was to
                            expose and familiarize the participants to GitHub and its collaborative coding techniques. The
                            session started with a welcome and introduction by Mr. Aditya Singh Chandel, followed by a
                            presentation by Mr. Abhimaan on GitHub and version control systems. He explained the
                            importance of collaborative coding and how to use repositories for different projects. Next,
                            Mr. Krish showed us how to create a GitHub account, link it to our student ID, and access the
                            student developer pack. He also demonstrated how to create a repository, collaborate with
                            others, and deploy different versions of our pages. The club coordinators were very helpful and
                            answered our questions throughout the session. The session was very informative. At the end,
                            we were given a task to create a contact card in GitHub with our basic contact details and deploy
                            it online.
